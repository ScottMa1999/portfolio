          <h2>Developer <span>& Designer</span></h2>
          <p>Thank you guys for spending time visiting my portfolio website! This is Scott, I'm a new graduate student who is pursuing the career path of a full-stack developer. I would love to introduce myself in four words, "dreaming, passionate, consistent & optimistic". I dream of creating applications and websites that can be used and enjoyed by millions of people, I dream of one day I can open up my own company to design and host websites for other companies. I sincerely hope I can be the kind of guy who can constantly bring hope and benefits to people around me. Besides my coding career, I'm also a guitarist and chef, I have been trained on guitar for more than 6 years, and cooked for more than 10 years. I love to cook different kinds of Michelin dishes for friends around me. Based on my past experiences, I enjoyed the feeling of consistently learning, I enjoyed the feeling of becoming a greater person day by day.</p>

            <p>I have been playing guitar for more than 6 years. I really can't help myself love the feeling of calming and releasing myself through playing music. It's quite hard to explain how fantastic it feels. I love playing guitar by adding fingerstyle and percussive techniques. There is just so much fun and so many techniques to learn inside this instrument. I will keep diving deeper and hopefully one day I can publish my personal albums</p>

I love to see how they tease up their customers' tongues and grab their hearts by adding up different magical tastes altogether inside their dishes. There is just so much fun inside of cooking! I have been training myself in cooking for more than ten years, I love to see the comfortable and satisfied smiles on my friends' faces everytime when I cook for them.</p>

            <p>Calligraphy means writing perfect-looking handwriting. It's kind of similar to drawing and painting. My dad is good at Calligraphy, I can still remember he told me that how you write can normally reflect what kind of person you are and how your spirit looks like. Although that sounds like bull shit to me when I was young, in my 10 years of continuous learning, I found that learning Calligraphy did help me a lot on becoming a more concentrated and peaceful person.</p>
